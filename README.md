# 🪙 web3-payments-kit

**A modular toolkit for enabling Web3 payments across multiple blockchain networks.**

---

### 🌍 Overview

`web3-payments-kit` is a flexible, developer-friendly library designed to simplify the integration of **Web3 payments** into any web application.
It provides multiple methods for processing, verifying, and recording crypto payments through **Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum**, and other EVM-compatible chains — all with minimal setup.

The goal is to make **multi-chain crypto payments** as simple as traditional APIs — without the need for deep blockchain expertise.

### ✨ Features

* **Multi-Chain Support** — Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, and other EVM-compatible networks.
* **Multiple Wallet Integrations** — MetaMask, WalletConnect, and custom Web3 wallets.
* **Payment Verification Utilities** — Includes tools to verify signed messages, receipts, and on-chain confirmations.
* **Gas Optimization Strategies** — Learn and use meta-transactions or off-chain relayers to minimize gas costs.
* **Pluggable Architecture** — Add your own payment methods or networks easily.
* **Flexible Data Storage** — Choose between fully on-chain, hybrid (on/off-chain), or off-chain verifications.
* **Developer Focused** — Clear APIs, modular setup, and TypeScript-ready.

### 🧩 Core Concepts

#### 1. Payment Abstraction

Use a single unified interface to handle payments across multiple chains. Developers can switch between Ethereum, Polygon, or Arbitrum without changing core logic.

#### 2. Message Signing & Verification

Handle off-chain signature validation securely using cryptographic verification methods (like `ethers.verifyMessage`) to confirm user consent before executing transactions.

#### 3. Meta-Transactions

Enable **gasless payments** using relayers — so users can authorize actions without paying gas directly.

#### 4. On-Chain & Off-Chain Sync

Choose between storing transaction data directly on the blockchain or maintaining off-chain databases (for cost efficiency).

### 🛠️ Use Cases

* Accept Web3 payments on websites and DApps
* Implement token-based subscriptions or premium access
* Build decentralized e-commerce or donation portals
* Create hybrid payment systems using both fiat and crypto
* Develop relayer or meta-transaction infrastructures
